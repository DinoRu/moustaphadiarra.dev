## Code Blocks

Flutter basic app

```dart:flutter-main.dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Hello Flutter'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Welcome to Flutter!',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

```

## What does this code do?

    - main(): This is the entry point of the Flutter app. It runs the MyApp widget.
    - MyApp: A stateless widget that builds the overall structure of the app. It sets up a MaterialApp with a title, theme, and MyHomePage as the home screen.
    - MyHomePage: This widget displays a simple screen with an app bar and a centered text saying "Welcome to Flutter!"
